Slot Machine Game
A simple Python-based slot machine game that lets you bet and play.

Description
This game simulates a 3x3 slot machine, where the user can deposit an amount, bet on a certain number of lines, and try their luck to win! The game consists of different symbols, each having its own count and value.

How to Play
Deposit the amount you want to play with.
Choose the number of lines you'd like to bet on (from 1 to 3).
Set your bet for each line.
Spin the slot machine and see if you've won!
Symbols
The slot machine uses the following symbols with the respective count and value:

A (Count: 2, Value: 5)
B (Count: 4, Value: 4)
C (Count: 6, Value: 3)
D (Count: 8, Value: 2)
The symbols are randomly placed in the slot machine columns, and if all symbols in a line match, you win the corresponding amount based on the symbol's value times your bet.
